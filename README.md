# Get geographical area and membership hjids values from CDS data extract

## Introduction

In order to allow for data from the CDS export (in future CDS format) to be incorporated successfully into the database, we need to utlise the hjid fields in the datasets produced from CDS, even though these are not Taric-3 compliant fields.

The way to do this is to do the following:

- Take the full extract of data from CDS that is due to be produced on Jan 2nd (TBC)

- Download a copy of this full data set (in CDS format)

- Run this Python script to create a full list of all of the hjids associated with these two data objects
